      <p>
        Hello! My name is Adarsh Kathiresan, and I am a passionate software
        developer with a strong focus on building scalable and efficient
        applications. I specialize in modern web development technologies,
        particularly TypeScript, React, and Node.js.

      <p>
        I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and
        contributing to open-source projects. My goal is to create impactful
        software that makes a difference in people's lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, reading
        books, or experimenting with side projects to sharpen my skills.
