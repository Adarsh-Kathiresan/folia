# folia

portfolio - create a polished, public developer profile that showcases your work with a clean UI, responsive layout, and scalable architecture.

## Details

The site will have five primary pages: Hero, About, Projects, Showcase and Contact

4. **SHOWCASE** - Functions like a feed: users can either scroll through or select from a list of lazily loaded components, each representing demos or code experiments you've built. This section emphasizes dynamic rendering and modular design to highlight creativity and technical depth.

## Tech

### DEVELOP

React + TypeScript scaffolded via Vite, with React Router v7+. The site will use lazy loading (React.lazy) for feed components, SCSS for structured and themeable styling (with CSS variables), and responsive design throughout.

### DEPLOY

Deployment will be handled through GitHub Pages, and the entire codebase will be pushed to GitHub early in the process for versioning and collaboration.
